1. Add this column to the table.

```jsx
<td>{book.authorFullName}</td>
```

2. You query the server for all of the books and all of the authors but no other server changes are allowed.

3. In the client side code, create book object that has an authorFullName property that can then be used to render the table.

4. Ensure it works!
