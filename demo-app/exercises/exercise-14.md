# Exercise 14

1. Create a new hook named `useCarToolStore`. Move the application state from Car Tool to the new hook. Utilize the new hook in Car Tool to manage the application state.

2. When deleting a car display a confirm dialog in the DOM tree. Do not worry about styling it to make popup in the center or act like a modal. Just somewhere in the DOM tree when the delete button is clicked display a component with two buttons: Yes and No. If the Yes button is clicked delete the car. If the No button is clicked do not delete the car.

3. Ensure it works.
