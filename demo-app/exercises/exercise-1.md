# Exercise 1

## Requirements

1. Create a new page name "Car Tool". Be sure to add a menu item and a route. Display a header with an `h2` element similar to how we did a header for `Home` and `ColorTool` components.

1. Below the header in Car Tool, add a table of cars (please use an HTML table and the related table elements). The table of cars should be in the Car Tool component. The table should have a header row with the following column headers:

Id, Make, Model, Year, Color, Price

1. Hard code two rows of car data. Not 1 row, not 3 or more rows - just 2 rows. And hard code the rows, do not dynamically generate them.

1. Reload the page, and ensure the table is displayed beneath the header of Car Tool.

1. Ensure it works!
